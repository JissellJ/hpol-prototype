# rnog-hpol-prototype
This contains code and data created while working towards a finalized hpol antenna for RNO-G.

None of this code is particularly refined at this point as it is basically just plotting files from the network analyzer.  I use some functions that are defined from another package: [plot_ff.py](https://github.com/djsouthall/beacon/blob/master/tools/plot_ff.py).  These aren't complicated and could easily be redifined in this project, but I am the only one using it and this is fine for me.
